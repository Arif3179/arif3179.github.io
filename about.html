                    <p>My name is Arif Rahmawan, you can just call me "Arif", i am former telecommunication consultant,i was Radio Access (RAN) Engineer who specialized in Ericsson platform,i worked for more than 15 years in telecommunication industry since 2004, i gained a lot of travelling experience with my previous carrer,because i have involved in various RAN deployment project in 9 different countries, i was so lucky.</p>
                    <p>As the information technology is always growth and changed,soon my ability is become obsolute, new technology is more advanced and need less people getting involved,everything now can be automated through machine learning or artificial inteligence,the industry seems does not need us anymore, as like happen to me, getting new job contract is becoming hard now. Because i always have high curiossity on IT world and i have passionate to decode and solve a problem. So, i decided to change my carrer as programer.</p>
                    <p>And now here i am, this is my first personal website. </p>
